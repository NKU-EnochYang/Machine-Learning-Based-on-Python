# Naive Bayes Classification

Basic implement of naive bayes classification algorithm. 



## Description

The functions of  this project are shown below: 

```bash
1. Naive Bayes classification
2. K-fold cross validation
3. Calculation of confusion matrix, precision, recall and F1 score of this model
4. ROC curve drawing and calculation of AUC
```
